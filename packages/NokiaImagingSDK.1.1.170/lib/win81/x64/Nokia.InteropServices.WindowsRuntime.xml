This class should be derived from in order to create an IBuffer implementation. It can then
be used by the Buffer class which handles all the WinRT/COM specifics.
<para>Make sure the OpenData method returns your custom BufferDataPolicyBase-derived object.</para></remarks>

            <summary>Base class for IBufferByteAccess implementation policies.</summary>
            <remarks>
This class should be derived from and wraps logic "during" buffer data access.
An object of the class will be created when the data is starting to be accessed, and destroyed when
the data is no longer used. NOTE: This differs from normal WinRT semantics! But holds true for the SDK.
